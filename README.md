# MonkeyPOX-Classification

In this project, we design an android app to detect monkeypox.
To train our model, we used 1428 images for the class MonkeyPox and
1764 for the class Non Monkeypox. We train the algorithm on the Passio Mobile AI Platform
and we have obtained an accuracy of 87% on the training set and 96% on the test set.

You can download the app in the folder app -> build -> outputs -> apk -> debug

You can test the algorithm using some of the images uploaded in this project
