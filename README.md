# MonkeyPOX-Classification

Monkeypox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus that can occur in certain animals, including humans. Symptoms begin with fever, headache, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes, and feeling tired.
An ongoing outbreak of monkeypox was confirmed on 6 May 2022, beginning with a British resident who, after traveling to Nigeria (where the disease is endemic), presented symptoms consistent with monkeypox on 29 April 2022. The resident returned to the United Kingdom on 4 May, creating the country's index case of the outbreak.

In this project, we design an android app to detect monkeypox.
To train our model, we used 1428 images for the class MonkeyPox and
1764 for the class Non Monkeypox. We train the algorithm on the Passio Mobile AI Platform
and we have obtained an accuracy of 87% on the training set and 96% on the test set.

You can download the app in the folder app -> build -> outputs -> apk -> debug

You can test the algorithm using some of the images uploaded in this project.

You can also see some results obtained by testing the app on some images
